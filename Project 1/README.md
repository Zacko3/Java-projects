Tic-Tac-Toe with a 4x4 grid.
The game is played between two players who take turns marking X and O on the board until one player gets four marks in a row either horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally. The game is designed to run in the console and includes basic error checking to prevent invalid moves.
The project demonstrates basic Java concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and arrays.
